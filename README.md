# Neural Networks for Real-World Problems

This repository contains a collection of tutorials that teach you how to create simple neural networks and apply them to real-world problems and datasets. The goal is to provide a practical introduction to the basics of neural networks, while also showing you how to apply this knowledge to solve problems you might encounter in your own work.

## Getting Started
To get started with the tutorials, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

``` git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-neural-networks.git ```


## Tutorials
Currently, the following tutorials are available:

- Image Classification with MNIST: This tutorial teaches you how to create a Convolutional neural network using Keras to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.

- Breast Cancer Classification: This tutorial teaches you how to create a simple neural network using Keras to performa  binary classification

Each tutorial includes step-by-step instructions for creating the neural network and applying it to the  dataset. Each tutorial can be open with  Jupyter notebook that you can use to  experiment with different settings and configurations.
